<p>Candy Friends, let's talk about something not-so-sweet happening in faraway lands.</p>
<p>Imagine a place called Myanmar that grows flowers called poppies. But guess what? These poppies make a not-so-good thing called opium. It's a bit like when you find something in the candy store that's not your favorite flavor.</p>
<p>Now, Myanmar became the biggest poppy grower in the world! But wait, wasn't Afghanistan the champion before? Yes, but the rulers there said, &quot;No more poppies, please!&quot; and stopped growing them. So, Myanmar said, &quot;We'll do it!&quot; and now they're the poppy-growing kings.</p>
<p>Why do they grow poppies? Well, some tricky things happened. Myanmar had a big change in who's in charge, and some folks didn't like it. So, they thought growing poppies might help them in a not-so-nice way.</p>
<p>Growing poppies can make a special thing called opium, and that's not good for people. It's like having too many candies and feeling not-so-good afterward.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, there are places with big hills where they grow these poppies, and it's not always easy for the grown-ups to keep things in control. Some people even use poppies to make strong things like medicine that they should not!</p>
<p>The tricky thing is that growing poppies is becoming a big business, and it's not very nice. Some of the places where poppies grow have some problems, and it's making things not-so-fun for everyone.</p>
<p>But guess what? Candy Friends, we hope Myanmar and other faraway lands find sweet ways to make everyone happy without growing those not-so-good poppies. Let's send them lots of candy love and wish for better days ahead! üåàüç¨</p>
