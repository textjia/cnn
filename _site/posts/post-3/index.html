            <h1>Sad Day Turned into a Sweet Memory # 💔🍬</h1>
<p>Hey there, sweet little pals! I have a story that starts with sadness but turns into something special, just like when you mix your favorite candies to create a new tasty treat!</p>
<p>So, there's a boy named Ethan Crumbley who did something really, really wrong. He hurt some friends at a school in Michigan. But you know what? Even in the saddest moments, there's sweetness to be found.</p>
<p>The families and friends of those hurt by Ethan got to share their feelings in a big room. They talked about how much they missed their loved ones and how their lives changed. It was like telling stories about their favorite candies, each one unique and special.</p>
<p>One mom, Nicole Beausoleil, bravely spoke about her daughter, Madisyn, who couldn't graduate because of what happened. She remembered Madisyn as a shining star, not just a sad story. Madisyn, she said, is like the stars that shine in the dark.</p>
<p>Other moms and dads also talked about their children, and even though they were really sad, they wanted to show how strong and brave they are. They said that the person who did this should spend a long time thinking about what they did.</p>
<p>But you know what's amazing? These families are finding a way to be sweet and strong, just like your favorite candies. They're turning their pain into love and kindness.</p>
<p>So, my little friends, remember that even on the saddest days, there can be moments of sweetness and strength. And just like when you share your candies with friends, these families are sharing love and memories of their special ones. 🌟💕</p>
