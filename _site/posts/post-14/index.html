<p>Hey there, candy pals! Gather around for the most incredible news from Candyland! Imagine winning the yummiest treats not once but twice! It's like a candy dream come true!</p>
<p>So, there's this amazing candy named Wayne Murray, and he's like the luckiest candy ever! 🍀🍬 He won a super special prize of $10 million in the New York Lottery's games – not just once, but two times! Wowzers! 😲🎉</p>
<p>The first time, Wayne won in the Black Titanium scratch-off game, and then, get this, he won again, this time in the 200X scratch-off game! It's like he's the master of unlocking candy treasures! 🗝️🍫</p>
<p>Wayne didn't want to wait; he chose to get his candy fortune in one big lump – $6,122,400! That's like a mountain of candies to swim in! 🏰🍬</p>
<p>What's even more magical is that both winning tickets came from the same H &amp; A Gas &amp; Convenience store in Brooklyn. It's like that store is a secret candy paradise! 🎈🍭</p>
<p>Wayne said winning feels &quot;very humbling and liberating.&quot; It's like the sweetest adventure in Candyland, where candies win big and spread joy everywhere! 🌟🍭</p>
<p>And guess what? The odds of winning these special candy games are like finding a candy unicorn – 1 in 3.5 million for the 200X game and 1 in 3.6 million for the Black Titanium game! 🦄🍀</p>
<p>Candyland is buzzing with excitement, and we're celebrating Wayne's double candy luck! It's like a candy party that never ends! 🥳🍬💖</p>
