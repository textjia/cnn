            <h1>Japan's Word of the Yearv - &quot;Tax&quot; # 💰</h1>
<p>Hey there, little pals! Guess what? In Japan, they have a special word of the year, and this time it's &quot;tax&quot;! 🌟💴</p>
<p>Imagine &quot;tax&quot; is like a special sticker on things you buy or the money you get from your grown-ups. The grown-ups in Japan had lots of talks about this sticker throughout the year because they wanted to make sure everything is fair and square! 🗣️🤝</p>
<p>People in Japan were a bit worried because the cost of things was going up, like when the price of candy or toys goes a bit higher. 🍬💸 But the grown-ups wanted to figure out the best way to handle it, just like when you and your friends decide on rules for your games. 🎲✨</p>
<p>Some friends said, &quot;Next year, there might be talks about more stickers on things like snacks and even some special rules for businesses.&quot; It's kind of like planning new ways to play together! 🍭🏭</p>
<p>The second-favorite word was &quot;heat&quot; because Japan had a super hot summer! 🌞🔥 And the third-favorite word was &quot;war,&quot; which is a bit serious and makes everyone think about being kind to each other instead. 🕊️❤️</p>
<p>So, even if grown-up talks about money seem tricky, they're just trying to make everything nice for everyone. Let's hope for a year full of fun and fairness in Japan! 🎉</p>
