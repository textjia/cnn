<p>Candy Hero:</p>
<p>Ryan O'Neal was not just a candy actor; he was also a hero to his family. His son Patrick said, &quot;My dad passed away peacefully today,&quot; surrounded by love from his family. In Candyland, we believe that heroes live on forever in our hearts.</p>
<p>Sweet Memories:</p>
<p>Ryan O'Neal had a magical career filled with candy adventures. He starred in movies that made people feel all kinds of emotions, from laughing to crying. One of his famous movies, &quot;Love Story,&quot; even had a line that said, &quot;Love means never having to say you're sorry.&quot;</p>
