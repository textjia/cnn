<p>China is planning some big changes, but there's a twist in the story. Let's turn it into a candy adventure! 🚀🌈🍭🌟</p>
<p>In the magical land of Candyland, the leaders had a big meeting hosted by President Candy Xi Jinping. They wanted to make Candyland's economy even better and sweeter! 🍬🍭</p>
<p>At the meeting, they said, &quot;Let's focus on growing Candyland while keeping everything stable. We want the best, high-quality candy development for everyone!&quot;</p>
<p>The leaders were super excited about making Candyland grow more, but some candy experts wondered if it would work without doing something special for the candy lovers – like you! 🤔🍬</p>
<p>The candy experts said, &quot;Hmm, they didn't talk about giving more candies to the candy lovers or making them super happy.&quot; 🍬😟</p>
<p>You see, Candyland has a little problem. People aren't buying enough candies, and the leaders want to change that. But they didn't say exactly how they'll do it. 📉🍭</p>
<p>The candy experts at Citi said, &quot;[There was] no hint for massive candy support policies. They didn't talk about giving more candies to the candy lovers to make them super happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Some candy lovers worry that without special plans for more candies and fun, reaching the big goal of growing Candyland might be tricky. 🎢🍫</p>
<p>But wait, there's another sweet twist! Candyland is also facing a problem called &quot;deflation.&quot; That means prices might go down, and the candy lovers might wait to buy more candies, thinking they'll get cheaper later. 📉💸</p>
<p>The leaders said, &quot;We need to make sure there are enough candies and money for everyone. We want to keep prices just right so that all the candy lovers can enjoy.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a new idea! They even mentioned &quot;the price target&quot; to make sure everything stays sweet. 🎯🍭</p>
<p>Oh, and guess what? They used to say, &quot;Houses are for living in, not for speculation.&quot; But now, they're changing it a bit. It's like saying, &quot;Let's build more candy houses and have fun!&quot; 🏠🍬</p>
<p>In Candyland, they want to fix some things in the candy world, especially in the places where candy houses are. It's like they're saying, &quot;Let's make more sweet homes, fix the old ones, and build cool candy places for everyone to enjoy!&quot;</p>
<p>So, Candyland is going to be a busy and exciting place! They're fixing the candy economy, making sure there are enough candies, and building fantastic candy homes. 🏰🍭</p>
