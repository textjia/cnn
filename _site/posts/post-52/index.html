            <h1>Sad News in Candyland - Andre Braugher, Our Star Friend, Went to a Candy Paradise at 61 # 🍭🎬🌟</h1>
<p>Oh no, candy pals, we have some sad news in Candyland. 🍬😢 Andre Braugher, the amazing actor from &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; and &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street,&quot; has left our candy world at 61. He got sick for a little while, and now he's having a sweet adventure in the candy sky. 🌈🍫</p>
<p>Andre was a super-duper talented actor who won a special award called an Emmy for being an awesome detective in &quot;Homicide.&quot; He also made us laugh a lot as Captain Holt in &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine.&quot; What a fun guy! 😄👮‍♂️</p>
<p>He started his acting journey in a movie called &quot;Glory&quot; and even played a baseball hero named Jackie Robinson. Wow, what a cool friend he was! 🎥⚾️</p>
<p>Terry Crews, Andre's candy buddy from &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine,&quot; shared on Instagram how much he'll miss Andre. They had eight sweet years together, making us all laugh. 🤗💖</p>
<p>NBC and Universal Television, where Andre did his TV magic, said he was an actor that everyone wanted to be like. They're going to miss him a lot, and so will we. 📺❤️</p>
<p>Even though he's not with us in Candyland anymore, Andre Braugher's talent will always be in our hearts. Let's send him lots of sweet thoughts and remember all the fun times he gave us! 🌟🍭</p>
