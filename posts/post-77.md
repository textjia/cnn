# Brave Ice in Trouble! # 😢🏰

Hey there, little friend! So, imagine a place called Thailand, and there's this superhero named Ice, who's also a lawmaker. 🦸‍♀️ But wait, something not-so-fun happened. Ice got into trouble for saying things on the computer. 😟

Ice was talking about some important stuff, like vaccines and a big protest, but the leaders didn't like it. 😕 In Thailand, they have rules about talking about kings and queens, and Ice kinda broke those rules. Now, she has to go to a not-so-fun place for six years. 💔

But here's the thing – Ice is super strong and has friends who believe in her. She can still ask if this decision is okay, and maybe things will get better. 🌈✨

People in Thailand are talking about making things better for everyone. Even though it's a bit tricky, they're saying, "Let's be kind and let everyone talk without worries." 🗣️💙

So, Ice, even though things seem tough now, there's hope for a happy ending! Let's hope for a brighter day for Ice and her friends! 🌟🍬
