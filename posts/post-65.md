# Trouble Between Friends! # 😢

Hey little friend! So, imagine there are two buddies, the White House (where President Biden works) and Prime Minister Netanyahu from Israel. They used to be super close, like peanut butter and jelly!

But lately, they're having some disagreements. It's like when you and your friend can't decide on which game to play. The White House friend, who is also President Biden, thinks that the way Israel is doing things in a place called Gaza is not very nice. He even said their actions are like using a water gun without aiming!

Now, the two buddies are not playing nicely, and other friends from different countries, like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, are saying, "Hey, let's stop this and talk it out!" It's a bit like when you see your friends arguing, and you hope they can find a solution.

President Biden's helper, Jake Sullivan, is going to Israel to try and fix things. They want to talk about how to help the people in Gaza and how to be more careful in their actions. It's a bit like when you say sorry and promise to be more careful after a little disagreement.

But it's tricky because some people are not happy with how things are going. There's a big hope that everyone can find a way to be friends again and play together nicely. Let's send them good vibes for peace and friendship! 🌈🤝
