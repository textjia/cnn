The big bosses of football, the NFL, just announced something super cool! They're going to play a real game in São Paulo, Brazil, during 2024. It's like having a candy party in a new city!

Brazil has lots and lots of football fans, about 38 million of them! And get this, they're going to play the game in a magical stadium called Corinthians Stadium, where usually a soccer club named Corinthians plays. It's going to be like watching your favorite candy team in a whole new place!

But wait, there's more! The NFL is also going to play games in London and Munich. It's like having football adventures all over the world!

And guess what? The Super Bowl, the biggest football party of all, is coming back to a special place called SoFi Stadium in California in 2027! It's going to be the ninth time they have the Super Bowl in that area. How cool is that?

So, get ready for some touchdowns, cheers, and maybe even some candy treats as football travels to amazing places! 🎉🍭
