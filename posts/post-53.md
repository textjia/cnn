Ahoy, candy adventurers! Get ready for a sweet voyage because Villa Vie Residences is launching a super-duper long candy cruise! 🚢🌍 They're calling it the "Villa Vie Odyssey," and it's going to sail around the world for three-and-a-half years, starting in May 2024.

Guess what? They bought a special candy ship called the MS Braemar, renamed it the Villa Vie Odyssey, and it's going to be the coolest candy home ever! 🍬🏠 This ship is like a magic candy box with eight decks, a big pool, and even Jacuzzi tubs for lots of bubbly fun.

On this candy cruise, you can visit 147 countries and 425 ports! That's like going on a candy treasure hunt around the world. 🌏🗺️ And here's the best part – you can stay onboard for as little as 35 days or the whole three-and-a-half years! It's like choosing your candy adventure.

The candy ship will have yummy places to eat, like three restaurants and eight bars. Plus, there's going to be a spa, a fitness center, a library, and even a medical center in case you eat too many sweets! 🍦📚

Oh, and don't worry about getting bored. They'll have fast internet for playing candy games, a cool cooking class, and a golf program with a special golf simulator! ⛳🎮

Now, for all you candy-loving friends who can't commit to the whole three-and-a-half years, no worries! You can join for short candy visits and still have loads of fun. 🎉💖

Prices start from $89 per person per day, and you can either rent a candy cabin or buy your very own candy villa. Renting is like buying a ticket, and buying means you get a sweet candy home for the whole adventure! 🏡🎫

All the candy-loving perks like food, soft drinks, and even WiFi are included. Imagine swimming in the candy pool, having tasty treats, and exploring the world – all in one sweet trip!
