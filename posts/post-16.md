# Sweet Victory for Ice Candy King Ilia Malinin! # üç≠‚ùÑÔ∏è

Once upon a snowy day in Candyland, there was a young candy wizard named Ilia Malinin who was really good at making magical jumps on the ice. He loved to skate and make everyone in Candyland smile!

Magical Candy Jumps:

Ilia did something super special during a big ice-skating party in China. He did a jump called a quadruple axel, and guess what? No one had ever done it before during a short program! It's like doing a super-duper spin in the air, and Ilia made it look so easy!

Sweet Victory:

Even though he had a little slip while trying the jump again, Ilia didn't let it bother him. He skated with joy and got a super high score - 207.76! That's like getting a magical score for making everyone in Candyland happy.

"It's an incredible feeling," Ilia said, and everyone cheered because they were so happy for him!

Candy Competitors:

Ilia was better than all the other candy skaters, even Uno Shoma from Japan, who is really, really good too. Ilia got a total of 314.66 points, and that's a super big number in Candyland!

Quadruple Axel Magic:

Ilia is the only candy wizard to ever do the quadruple axel in a big ice-skating show. It's like doing four-and-a-half spins in the air - that's a lot! Everyone in Candyland was amazed because even the best candy skaters couldn't do it before Ilia.

The Candy King Speaks:

Ilia said he was glad he could do the special jump. He had done it before, but this time, it was extra special because it was during the short program with fewer tricks. Ilia felt a little pressure, but he smiled and made everyone proud.

"I'm just really glad that I was able to pull it off," Ilia said, and Candyland cheered louder than ever!

Sweet Changes:

Ilia had taken out the cool jump from his shows this year, but he decided to bring it back because he wanted to show everyone how awesome it is. He even said the points for the jump should be more, like extra special candy points!

The Candy Legacy:

Ilia is like a candy hero in Candyland. For 44 years, no one could do the magical quadruple axel, but Ilia changed that! He spins in the air like a candy tornado, making everyone believe in magical dreams.

And so, in Candyland, Ilia Malinin became the Ice Candy King, and his victory made everyone dance with joy and celebrate with the sweetest treats!
