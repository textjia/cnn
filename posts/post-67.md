# Oopsie at Candy Land! # 🍭🏰

Hey there, little candy explorer! Imagine there's a magical candy kingdom, and Bernard Looney was the king of a big candy castle called BP. But guess what? Something not-so-fun happened in Candy Land!

King Looney didn't share all the important information about his friendships with his candy castle friends. The big decision-makers, like the candy board, found out he wasn't completely honest. Oh no!

So, the candy board said, "King Looney, you didn't tell us everything, and that's not okay." They decided he couldn't be the king anymore, and he didn't get a big bag of candy called severance—about $40 million worth!

King Looney left the candy castle in September, and now he can't have any more candy from the castle. No more candy salary, no candy bonuses, nothing! It's like if you had to give back some of your favorite candies.

But don't worry, the candy castle has a new leader for now, Murray Auchincloss. He's taking care of things and making sure everyone shares their candy secrets. Let's hope Candy Land stays sweet and honest! 🏰🍬
