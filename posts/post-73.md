# Japan's Word of the Yearv - "Tax" # 💰

Hey there, little pals! Guess what? In Japan, they have a special word of the year, and this time it's "tax"! 🌟💴

Imagine "tax" is like a special sticker on things you buy or the money you get from your grown-ups. The grown-ups in Japan had lots of talks about this sticker throughout the year because they wanted to make sure everything is fair and square! 🗣️🤝

People in Japan were a bit worried because the cost of things was going up, like when the price of candy or toys goes a bit higher. 🍬💸 But the grown-ups wanted to figure out the best way to handle it, just like when you and your friends decide on rules for your games. 🎲✨

Some friends said, "Next year, there might be talks about more stickers on things like snacks and even some special rules for businesses." It's kind of like planning new ways to play together! 🍭🏭

The second-favorite word was "heat" because Japan had a super hot summer! 🌞🔥 And the third-favorite word was "war," which is a bit serious and makes everyone think about being kind to each other instead. 🕊️❤️

So, even if grown-up talks about money seem tricky, they're just trying to make everything nice for everyone. Let's hope for a year full of fun and fairness in Japan! 🎉
