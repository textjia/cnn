Once upon a candy-coated time, a brave leader named President Zelensky took a magical trip to Washington! He wanted to ask his friends for help to defend his candy kingdom from some not-so-nice invaders.

Zelensky met with important people, like President Biden and other leaders, to share his story. He asked them for special candy shields and magic funds to protect his sweet land from the invaders. Zelensky was like a superhero, and he told everyone, "We need your help to make sure Candyland stays happy and peaceful!"

Here are five exciting takeaways from Zelensky's big day in Candyland:

1. Biden Promises Support: President Biden, another candy superhero, promised to help Ukraine for as long as they need it. He said, "The American people are proud to support Candyland, and we will give them candy shields and tools as long as we can!"

2. Zelensky's Candy Request: Zelensky talked to his friends in Congress and said, "I believe in you, and I need your support to keep Candyland safe." He even promised not to use the magic funds for anything tricky.

3. Candyland's Allies: Zelensky's friends in Congress listened carefully and wanted to help. They asked questions about how the magic funds would be used, and Zelensky assured them that everything would be done with honesty.

4. The Big Candy Gift: President Biden decided to give Ukraine a special candy gift of $200 million to help right away. It's like giving them a bag of extra-special candy to protect Candyland from the invaders.

5. Candy Christmas Wishes: Zelensky and his friends hope to make Candyland safe and happy again by Christmas. They dream of a Christmas filled with peace and joy, where everyone can enjoy their candy treats without any worries.
