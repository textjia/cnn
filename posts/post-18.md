McDonald's wants to keep things simple and quick at their main restaurants. So, to try these new magical drinks without making things too complicated, they made CosMc's its very own candy universe! This way, they can make sure everyone stays happy with their favorite meals.

CosMc's Secret Ingredients: 🍬🧪

CosMc's has the most amazing drinks like chai frappe bursts with boba, whipped cream, and cinnamon sprinkles! You can even add cool things like toffee sprinkles, black pepper sprinkles, and lots more. It's like creating your own candy potion with a touch of magic!

Learning and Having Fun: 📚🎉

McDonald's is trying something new with CosMc's to learn and have fun. Even though they're starting with just 10 special places, it's like a candy experiment to see what everyone likes. They want to make sure you have the most magical experience ever!
