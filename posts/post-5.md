# Candyland News: Sweet Talks About Orioles and a Magical Baseball Adventure! # 🌟🍭

Hey there, little candy enthusiasts! I have the most delightful story for you, straight from Candyland News!

Guess what? A super special person named David Rubenstein, who loves candy and baseball a whole lot, is talking about maybe getting a candy baseball team! 🍬⚾

So, there's this amazing team called the Baltimore Orioles, and David Rubenstein, who's like a candy wizard but for baseball, might become their new owner! Can you believe it? It's like being the captain of a candy spaceship!

David, who's super, duper rich and loves baseball so much, is having sweet talks with the Orioles' current owner, Peter Angelos. They're deciding if David should be the one to take care of the Orioles and make them even more fantastic.

But, here's the exciting part: the talks are like making a yummy cake! Right now, the cake isn't all ready, and there might be other candy wizards who want to join the party and own the Orioles too! 🎉🧁

The Orioles are like a candy treasure, and they're valued at a whopping $1.7 billion! That's a whole lot of candy coins! They've been playing baseball at a place called Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and they're even talking with the state of Maryland about their home.

Now, let's talk about David Rubenstein. He's a wise wizard, 74 years young, and he's a BIG fan of the Orioles. He's so good at making candy deals that he co-founded something called The Carlyle Group. Imagine Carlyle as a magical candy store for grown-ups!

David even thought about having another candy baseball team called the Washington Nationals. He's like the king of candy sports! 🤴🍬

So, keep an eye out for more news, little candy dreamers! We might soon hear if David Rubenstein becomes the magical owner of the Baltimore Orioles and turns their baseball games into the sweetest adventure ever! ⚾🌈✨
