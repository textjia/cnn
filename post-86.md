# Alex's Amazing Adventure! # 🌟

Once upon a time, there was a brave boy named Alex Batty who went on a big adventure! 🚀

🌍 Alex had been missing for a very long time, six whole years! But guess what? He was found in a magical place called France! 🇫🇷

Alex, who is now 17 years old, was found near the city of Toulouse. He had been walking for four days with his skateboard, jacket, backpack, and flashlight. A kind French driver named Fabien found him on the side of the road and helped him. 🚗

Alex told Fabien that his mom took him on a holiday when he was 11, but she didn't have the right permission. Alex spent three years in Spain and two years in France. Wow, that's a lot of adventures! 🌟

The best part is that Alex sent a message to his grandma saying, "Hello grandma, it is me, Alex. I am in France, Toulouse. I really hope you receive this message. I love you, and I want to come home." How sweet! 💖

Alex's grandma, Susan Caruana, is so happy to hear from him. She said, "I am so happy. I have spoken to him, and he is well. He is currently with the authorities in France. It is such a shock." 😊

The police in England, where Alex is from, are also helping to bring him back home. They want to make sure everything is safe and sound. 🏠👮‍♂️

So, Alex is on his way back to England to see his grandma and have a real-life with a real future. What an exciting adventure with a happy ending! 🎉

And they all lived happily ever after! The end. 🌈
