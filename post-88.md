# Brave Friends and Magic Quests in Hong Kong! # 🌟

Once upon a time in a faraway place called Hong Kong, some friends were on a special quest filled with magic and courage! 🚀✨

🕵️‍♂️ The friends, like superheroes, were being sought after by the Hong Kong police who put big bags of candies (HK$1 million or $128,000) for them! But these weren't ordinary candies; they were magic candies for finding special friends.

🎤 The police said the friends, including Joey Siu from the United States and Frances Hui from the United States too, were being accused of playing games that the grown-ups didn't like. But our brave friends said, "We love our home, Hong Kong, and we want everyone to have fun and be happy!"

🚁 Some friends, like Johnny Fok, Tony Choi, and Simon Cheng, live in a faraway land called Britain. They're also on the police's candy list! 🍬

🤖 The police leader, Steve Li, said the friends wanted to do things that made the grown-ups upset, like asking for more playtime and asking other lands to help. But our friends, they said, "We will keep talking because we love Hong Kong and want everyone to be friends!"

🗣️ Joey Siu, the friend from the United States, shouted on a special talking place called X (formerly Twitter), "I will never be quiet, and I will always stand strong!" 📣

💙 Frances Hui, another friend, said, "I will always love democracy and freedom, and I won't stop!" 🕊️

🏰 Simon Cheng, who lives in Britain, even got a special badge of honor! He said, "This is my badge of being brave forever!" 🏅

🌍 Other faraway lands like the United States and Britain said, "Oh no, this is not nice!" They told the Hong Kong leaders to stop and let the friends be happy. 🇺🇸🇬🇧

🌈 The friends and faraway lands want to remind everyone that magic quests for democracy and freedom should be celebrated, and everyone should have a fairytale life full of laughter and joy! The end. 🎉
